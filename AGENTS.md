# AGENTS.md

These instructions apply to automated agents working in this repo.

- Use Conventional Commits 1.0.0 for all commit messages (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `chore: ...`).
- Keep changes focused and small.
- Update docs or types when behavior changes.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes and tests exist.
- CI uses GitHub Actions; Lua tooling and LuaRocks are part of the workflow.
