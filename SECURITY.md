# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently supported versions are the latest release on the `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately by opening a GitHub Security Advisory:

- Click **Report a vulnerability**

If you cannot use GitHub advisories, open a private issue and clearly mark it as
security-sensitive.

We will acknowledge receipt and work on a fix as soon as possible.
