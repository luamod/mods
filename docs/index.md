  docs.

# Mods

Mods is a set of pure Lua modules for daily development. Minimal dependencies,
predictable APIs, and support for Lua 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, and LuaJIT. Use
modules through `require("mods")` and access helpers via `mods.<name>`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> We are still working on adding new modules and improving the docs.
